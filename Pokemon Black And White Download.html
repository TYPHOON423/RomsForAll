  <h2>Description</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version are Nintendo DS games that are the first core series Pokémon games of Generation V. The games were released in Japan on September 18, 2010, in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and in Australia on March 10, 2011. They take place in the Unova region. These games are enhanced on the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS families.

Pokémon Black and White follow the trends set by previous games in the series. Unlike previous games, Pokémon introduced prior to Generation V cannot be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma.

The games' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pokémon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10.

Pokémon Black and White were followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White. Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 are the second and final paired versions of Generation V.</p>
