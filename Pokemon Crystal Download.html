  <p>Pokémon Crystal Version is the third and final Generation II core series game for Game Boy Color. It was released as a solitary version to Pokémon Gold and Silver, which were released one year before. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000,
  in North America on July 29, 2001, and in Europe on November 2, 2001.

  It featured various fixes and some new additions, most notably the introduction of the option to play as a girl. It takes place in the region of Johto like Gold and Silver, with access to Kanto granted later in the game, with the player's starting
  town being New Bark Town.

  The Japanese version had far more new features, all related to a mobile phone-related linking technology usable through the Pokémon Mobile System GB when connecting a Mobile Game Boy Adapter to a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance.</p>
