  <h2>Description</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Pokémon Gold Version and Pokémon Silver Version were the first core series games of Generation II for the Game Boy Color.

    During development, the games had the tentative titles of Pocket Monsters 2 or Pokémon 2 and Pocket Monsters 2: Gold & Silver , along with a provisional release date of "late 1997". The number 2 was dropped as of Nintendo Space World ’97 in
    November 1997.

    Originally announced for a March 1998 release in Nintendo Space World '97, the games had their launch date postponed, with Nintendo issuing a public apology where it was claimed that the developers were worn out but fully committed to the project
    and that they required more time to expand and improve the games further. They were eventually released in Japan on November 21, 1999, in North America on October 15, 2000, and in Europe on April 6, 2001. In South Korea, Nintendo collaborated
    with Daewon to release the games in the country, which occurred on April 24, 2002; the Korean versions are solely compatible with the Game Boy Color, which was released there in 2000, also by Daewon.

    Unlike earlier games, Pokémon Gold and Silver take place in the Johto region, west of the region that the original games take place in, Kanto. However, Kanto can be traveled to later in the games.</p>
