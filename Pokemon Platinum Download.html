  <hr>
  <p>Pokémon Platinum Version is a solitary version to Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and the third Generation IV core series title.

The game was first seen on May 11, 2008 when a low-resolution cell-phone picture of an upcoming issue of CoroCoro magazine was leaked around the internet. On May 15, the magazine was officially released and the game was also officially confirmed by Nintendo. The game was released in Japan on September 13, 2008, in North America on March 22, 2009, in Australia on May 14, 2009, in Europe on May 22, 2009, and in Korea on July 2, 2009.

Like previous third versions, the region and starting area remain the same as in previously released paired versions; in Platinum, the player begins their journey from Twinleaf Town and travels across all of Sinnoh.</p>
